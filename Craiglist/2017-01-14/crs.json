I'm really open-minded and do not judge. In fact, I really like the quirky projects. I've written a dating book entitled 'Win Women Over by Ignoring Them'. It's not meant to be rude, but to be attention-grabbing because 'boring' doesn't grab attention. \n \nJust drop me a quick message with your project and how much you're paying. Can be anything you can think of that you need done. Then we can discuss further. \n \nA survey among retirees showed that in their twilight years, people regret 80% of what they didn't do rather than what they did. \n \nIf you have nothing on hand, but you're a creative and open-minded person, \nyou can visit my site at  http://ad.trwv.net/t.pl/95597/407375 \n \nIt's just a great way to share ideas. \n \nCheers! \n \nKelvin     ",
