Andrew Ng \nDear Ms Lo, \nWe wish to express our heartfelt gratitude and thanks for your teaching, care and guidance you had given our daughters for the past 9 years. Under your guidance, Li Lian's interest in piano and music had developed beyond our expectation. With your encouragement she has grown from an introvert child into a confident and musically creative teenager. My hushand, Peter and I would like to say A BIG THANK YOU for all the wonderful things you had done for Li Lian. . .. . .. . .. . . Peter &amp; Wee Lee Koh \nDear Ms Lo, \nThanks for your feedback. Your advice is noted. We will ensure Amanda spends more time to practise piano pieces. For your information, she was applauded and commended for her fine impromptu performance during the holiday with a chance to demonstrate her piano skill in a birthday banquet held for her grandparents in Shanghai. Many guests asked how and where we could find such a good piano teacher.\" Regards. . ... LK - Jan                                                    \nDear Ms Lo, \nSeason Greetings.

We have seen him gained much confidence while playing on his keyboard. Besides, he no longer finds practicing a chore but enjoys doing it to refine his skills. In the past, we used to see him getting frustrated whenever he's unsure about the pieces he's handling. Yet as parents, we are not able to coach him much as we do not have prior piano experience. We are relieved to see that Aidan is guided closely by you so much so that whenever he's home practicing, he knows exactly what to do, We are very blessed and grateful that Aidan has such a patient and motivating piano teacher like you. We look forword to Aidan taking his Grade 1 piano exam under your professional guidance. Thank again. Regards. . .. . .. . .. . .. . ...Geraldine \nDear Ms Lo \nThank you for a job well done. You had boost  Jervis's self esteem. He was feeling rather important about himself. I really appreciate your effort. . .. . .. . .. . ...   Serena Kang, Jervis's mother    \n ",
