The company is owned by Dillon and his wife Venza.  \n \nThe Work: \nCleaning Company Management- \nWe average 50 hours of phone time per month (which will be split between the 2 operators). You would be the 2nd operator. A little more than half of the calls are inbound, in which the operator must use their excellent sales skills to book the client for as much business as possible (within their budget). The other half of the calls relate mainly to managing the 6 (current , and 9 optimal) cleaners and their current appointments, as well as doing customer service and collecting payment. The manager will also be helping to write and rewrite procedural documents and analyze statistics to make suggestions that help the company to run more efficiently/profitably. This is our main income source and the initial training period will be focused solely on the Cleaning Company. As time goes on the time dispersion will look more like the attached figure.  \nInvestment Company- \nWe have bought and sold about 30 buildings over the past 10 years, we currently own 3 apartment buildings, and are in the process of buying a 4th. Our candidate will also be operating as a VA to help us do property research, contact sellers, and to manage our current tenants as well as schedule repairs with our various contractors or our main maintenance person. \nBooks/info products-  \nThe 1st book in the series of 5 books has already been written. The books are based on dating and relationship advice. Our VA will be assisting in contacting publishers, setting up workshops, marketing the books and info products, and anything else needed.  \n \nThe Best Candidate: \n-Our best candidate is probably an expat, or someone NOT living in the USA, preferably in a country with a low cost of living. We are specifically looking to outsource to a country where things are less expensive so that we can secure a long standing, super competent, worker and pay them more than they can usually make in their country of origin, at a price that supports us investing as much money as possible back into the company to grow it as fast as possible. As we grow, we will plan to raise up our foreign workers along with our success and let them become the pillars of the company.  \n-Either English is your First Language, OR, you are completely bilingual. Accents must be either non existent, or if one is detectable, it must never cause miscommunications with our house cleaning clients or cleaners (both of which are costly). Someone who used to live in an English speaking country or was raised speaking English is ideal. \nApplicant Must: \n-Be able to quickly learn our procedures, computer systems, as well as the geographic area and cultural nuances of Las Vegas. \n-Have Management experience. The ability to be direct (in your speech) to cleaners about what they need to do, and compel them to follow their commitments on appointments is critical.  \n-Have phone experience. This means you had a job in which you were on the phone for much of your workday.  \n-Have Quick Transactional Sales experience. \n-Have Excellent problem solving skills. \n-have Positive attitude and outlook on life.  \n \n \nThe Pay:  \n \nUP to $1,500USD  40 hours a week. There will likely be a 3 month probation period, depending on the candidate. We also have bonuses based on the gross income of the cleaning company.  \n \n \nTo APPLY:  \nGo to this link www.proficientclean.com/APP     ",
