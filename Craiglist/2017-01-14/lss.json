We have seen him gained much confidence while playing on his keyboard. Besides, he no longer finds practicing a chore but enjoys doing it to refine his skills. In the past, we used to see him getting frustrated whenever he's unsure about the pieces he's handling. Yet as parents, we are not able to coach him much as we do not have prior piano experience. We are relieved to see that Aidan is guided closely by you so much so that whenever he's home practicing, he knows exactly what to do, We are very blessed and grateful that Aidan has such a patient and motivating piano teacher like you. We look forword to Aidan taking his Grade 1 piano exam under your professional guidance. Thank again. Regards. . .. . .. . .. . .. . ...Geraldine, 7th Aug 2012 \n ",

I graduated from University of Seoul and a certified Korean and English teacher with 7 years of teaching experience.  \n \n2) How do I teach?  \n \nWhat I do best is that I can lead lessons to what you need whether it's a daily conversation or business Korean or TOPIK. I prefer conversational approach and use books, picture cards , vocabulary quizzes , TV news , and K-POP lyrics depending on your level and interests. Currently, I have Korean learning blog/ Facebook page where you can learn Korean through K-POP lyrics. \n( http://koreanthroughkpop.blogspot.com, http://www.facebook.com/koreanthroughkpop)  \n \n3) One more advantage :  \n \nMy Chinese skill is intermediate (HSK level 4 acquired last year). This will definitely help you understand the formation of Korean words because 70% of them are based on Chinese characters. I lived in Shanghai and Beijing for a year to study and work for an international freight forwarding company before. \n \n4) How many students do I have? \n \nI have 10 students in total.Their occupations are various such as English teachers, office workers, a lawyer , a paramedic , etc.  \n \n5) My hour rate?  25USD by Paypal \n \nI offer you a free trial lesson and then you can decide if you want to work with me or not.  \nMy rate could change depending on your hours of one lesson. Also, group lessons are available and the rate is negotiable.  \n \n6) One more thing to say with my other services  \n \nI am very serious at teaching, so I won't let you waste your time and money. I always give you homework and test you. I feel proud of myself when I see my students' lives becoming easy in Korea. So I always do my best. Please feel free to email me for more information or you can visit my Facebook  \nhttp://www.facebook.com/seo.eunha \n \nAlso, I offer English-Korean translation service. I helped a few foreigners find a housing , buy a car, file a report in Korean to the court of law , and visit their Korean families.     ",
