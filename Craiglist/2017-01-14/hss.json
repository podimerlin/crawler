They include rodents, termites, mosquitoes, cockroaches, bed bugs and lots more. Just as pests are different, they all also have their individual breeding and feeding habits.  \n \nAnd just as they differ in their feeding and eating habits, their extermination methods also vary. Various types of sprays, pesticides, repellants and traps have flooded the markets all in the attempt to create a solution to the problem of pests. But over the years, the use of these products has caused more harm than good. This is because wrong methods are often used ignorantly. And when this is done, the infestation may resurface, which may result in a significant outbreak, causing more problems.  \n \nSo, you may better off consulting a professional pest control service whenever you suspect the presence of pests on your property.  \n \nWe offers highly professional services at the best rate you can find in Singapore.

The aircon will function smoothly and last longer due to reduced strain on the system \n \nAlso recommended for cases where the aircon cooling is slow and insufficient. \n \nGood to have general chemical cleaning every once a year. \n \nDirty Aircon is normally the cause of poor cooling and not the lack of gas. Do not waste money on gas top up and still not cooling. If your other units cooling properly and one unit is not cooling enough then its not gas problem,its dirty aircon. if the cooling is there but slow it is also dirty aircon. \n \nSUNNY MARKETING SERVICES Biz Reg NoUEN: 53335123E \n \nCall 93763389     ",
