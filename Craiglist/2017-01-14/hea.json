Are you trading your time for money? This is termed as Linear Income or Work Income (there is nothing wrong with that, many people are on this income). You receive a paycheck based on how much work or time you put in.  Linear Income requires continued work. When you stop working, your income stops. \n \nLet me introduce you Passive or Residual Income. This is a better option; the income of the rich.  It is the most powerful and profitable source of income that keeps coming in on a regular basis, from the result of the work you did in the beginning -- meaning even when you are not working. \n \nResidual Income is not about \"get rich quick\" -- the concept very much misunderstood by many people. It requires effort, determination, especially in the beginning but your life will change. . . \"Right now, you can take advantage of the internet to create wealth by having your own e-Commerce business right away.\" \n \nOn 28 Oct, an exclusive meet and greet with President of Asia Pacific, Middle East &amp; Africa had been conducted at the Ballroom JW Marriott Hotel in New Delhi India.
