While it offers flexibility of 24 access suitable for a small group of businesses, most home owners or even businesses does not need 24/7 access. There are disadvantages going to self storage places and those space are normally very low ceilings and it is like a big maze from our customers experience using this kind of storage area. You have to make your own arrangements with the movers and buy your own carton boxes, travel down to the storage place to sign documents, to be around when your mover comes in with your items, have to stack the items yourself or forced to pay the movers, this applies the same for those big warehouse for rent as these operators charge via pallet size but everything else is additional for warehouse operators to stack for you or unstack for you during retrieval of your items, this is very very hard especially for ladies or older people. Some warehouse for rent or warehouse offering storage space using pallets. As it is stacked 5-6meters high up, there is a tendency that items might drop and you have to pay for shrink wrap services and labour charges of mover or transportation companies to help you with the work. Some warehouse companies advertise very cheap price like $45-$50 and knowing that 1 pallet is not enough, will add on charges even if you exceeded 1 pallet slightly. The warehouse for rent or warehouse storage companies will charge you 2 times the price. \nThe worst part is charging you for exceeding a certain height of 1m or 1.2neter. As your household storage items are not necessary in rectangle shapes, it can be fridge which are not good putting it lying down. Customers are advised to beware of unscrupulous storage warehouse companies which are not there to help store your document boxes or your household items or your company records. They try to lure you in and slaughter you like a cow when you need to access, when you need manpower to unstack your furniture or document boxes, everything becomes chargeable like assisting in unstacking, charge for stacking it back, charge for afterhours access or retrieval or charging you because they need to wrap up your items to be placed high up.
