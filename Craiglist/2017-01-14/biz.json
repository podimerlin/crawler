        "postingbody": " \n \n QR Code Link to This Post \n  \n \n&#8203;Video8 (8mm video tape) was launched into a market dominated by the VHS-C and Betamax formats. \n \nIn 1983 Sony Betamax had released the first camcorder called Betamovie. In response JVC released the compact VHS-C format which enabled the first handheld (rather than shoulder-mounted) camcorders. Sony's answer to these small cameras came in 1985 when they used Betamax-style U-load technology, but reduced the tape width from 12 millimeter to 8 millimeter, and the Video8 format was born. \n \nVideo 8 (8mm video tape) had one major advantage over the full-sized competition. Thanks to their compact-form factor, Video8 camcorders were small enough to hold in the palm of the user's hand. Such a feat was impossible with Betamax and VHS camcorders, which operated best on sturdy tripods or strong shoulders. Video8 also had an advantage in terms of time, because although VHS-C offered the same \"palmcorder\" size as Video8, the VHS-C tapes only held 40 minutes of time (SP). Thus Video8's 120-minute capacity served well for most users. (Both machines included longer playing modes at 120 and 240 minutes respectively, but at the cost of reduced quality images of only 220 lines resolution.) Longer sessions generally required additional infrastructure (AC power or more batteries), and hence longer recording-times offered little advantage in a true travelling environment. \n \nAs of early 2007, the analog 8 mm formats are nearing the end of the road. Standard Video8 is already extinct in the new camcorder market. \n \nTo preserve your precious video in the Video8 tape, convert it to high qulity DVD-video.

One of the co-founders of our company has 30 years experience in the retail industry. He encountered many problems with various POS systems. Some providers had the right software but not the right hardware. Some had the right hardware but no feasible software to go along with it. He then partnered up with our current Chief Information Officer to develop a working prototype of POS on the Go. They realised soon enough the need for mobility in the current technology intensive business space that we are in. How do we give people the best user experience without making the system complicated to use? How do we solve all their inventory management and sales problems without them spending a fortune? How do we solve more problems with less time on the computer? Those were the golden questions being addressed and POS on the Go was created. It took almost a year and a half of development with intensive testing to come up with the product that we have now. All the functions that have been created are useful functions that the retail industry needs. With the combination of expertise from both the co-founders they managed to pull together a user friendly, useful and relevant system for the retail industry. And yes both of them are Singaporean. This is a 100% Singaporean product. Do support us as we try to make Inventory Management, Sales Tracking and Customer Relationship Management as seamless and easy for you. Ultimately, Information Technology(IT) is meant to support your business and not hinder it. People set up companies to make profits and that his heavily tied to sales. So we figured why dont you handle your sales and we will handle the support. Sounds like a good deal? Contact us and soon you will realise we will be your choice for a POS solution. \n \n ",

For a few reason, if you're in a hurry to empty your Skills Future account, you're possibly capable of discovering one or guides that you could attend for free with the credits. \n \nFor instance, the \"human beings leadership Program\", and run by Capella Academy is a 24-hour direction costing $294.00. but, you'll also find publications like \"develop Human aid policy Framework\" with the aid of Human Capital (Singapore), which is simplest a sixteen-hour path but fees $615.00. \n \n2 However, many WDA publications are a part of a larger WSQ framework \n \nYou'll be receiving certificates for most WDA publications. But, a lot of them are just one module in a WSQ \"framework\". There are WSQ frameworks for a selection of categories, consisting of service Excellence, Retail, and innovative Industries. \n \nInside each framework, there are several qualifications, inclusive of a sophisticated certificates or diploma program. \n \nThe WSQ professional degree in leadership and that management program, as an example, is targeted at department managers. It entails approximately 8 modules or about a complete of 220 -- 260 training hours. The cost alone should be approximate $3,000. It's quite the commitment, to mention the least. And it's virtually going to set you back by using greater than what you're getting in your Skills Future credit score subsequent yr. \n \nBut hi there, to procure a $500 discount. \n \n3 Are you virtually mastering a talent? \n \nOne course, called \"management for outcomes\", organized via the Singapore country wide Employers Federation, charges $195 for sixteen education hours. The goals of the route are as an alternative numerous, which includes \"organizing performance control requirements and fulfillment standards\" and \"facts analysis in tracking performance\". However, we need to surprise, in sixteen hours, how a lot can one definitely research? \n \nOne ought to argue that, seeing that this specific route is centered at senior management, the skills aren't exactly taught but reinforced. Furthermore, if done over an extended time period, there might be greater opportunity to exercise what had being taught. \n \nHowever, in truth, most senior managers don't have the time to do the path part-time. They generally tend to get an afternoon or off for education and then it's back to the grind. The onus is probably on the man or woman to remember what they've been taught. Which brings me to my subsequent factor. \n \n4 Could training providers take gain of Skills Future credit? \n \nThroughout my quick stint in a bakery, I needed to first attend a simple meals handling course licensed through WSQ. It changed into grandly titled \"follow meals and Beverage safety and Hygiene policies and tactics\". \n \nThe route took the entire day, even though we spent more time in the lecture theater than absolutely having hands-on practice. By way of the end of the day, I realized I had spent extra time education to sleep with my eyes open that genuinely mastering something food related. However, due to the fact I had paid the $a hundred and fifty route rate, I were given the certificates and became now certified to preserve my actual gaining knowledge of journey inside the bakery. \n \nBecause it seems, this equal path is conducted by means of numerous training classes. I just \"lucked out\" that I was given trainers who were possibly greater inquisitive about incomes my cash than in truly making sure I learned whatever. Should there be possibilities now for more schooling companies to inflate their route price, specifically since it doesn't pop out of your pocket, however instead from your Skills Future credit score? Time will tell. \n \n5 Just how frequently is Skills Future credit score topped-up? \n \nWe cited earlier that a \"WSQ framework\" may want to cost within the region of $3000. Right now, there's no clear indication yet as to when the Skills Future credit is being topped up. We don't understand how frequently and through how a great deal. Until such records are made regarded, it would be tough to decide on any framework. \n \nEven if such information have become available, it may not be crowned up at a rate that might suit your selected mastering pace. in case you planned to finish the above-referred to expert degree path in 2 years, for example, however, did now not get hold of sufficient Skills Future credit to fully subsidize your mastering, you may unavoidably need to pay a part of the direction price yourself. \n \n \n \nSo how?! Can those new \"competencies\" in your \"destiny\" get you any real \"credit score\"? \n \nIt'll begin you off in small steps, with little quick guides here and there. Get you a certificate of Attendance or two, and perhaps activate some interest in a new enterprise -- it won't but, be a sports changer on your profession. That's going to need quite a few extra work and money, but howdy, any AngBao is better than no AngBao. \n \nSource: blog.moneysmart.sg \n \nVisit Us on: www.onestopaccounting.com \n \n ",
